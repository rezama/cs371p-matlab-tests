Build Instructions
------------------
Copy agent.py over the one found by default in the Maze folder. Run the program using ./OpenNERO.


Switching between Modes
-----------------------
To switch between pure tabular, tiling, and nearest neighbors, modify the self.method_to_use variable found in the initializer for AgentBrain.

method_to_use values correspond to the different modes as follows:

1 = pure tabular
2 = tiling
3 = nearest neighbors


Tiling Implementation
